Bookstore - Full-Stack Application
Overview
This is a full-stack web application for a bookstore that allows users to view books, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. The backend is powered by Flask and exposes RESTful APIs, while the frontend is built with React. The application uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Flask-RESTful for creating API endpoints.

This application is designed to be a full-stack project, showcasing the integration between a Flask backend and a React frontend.

Features
Book Listings: Display books available for purchase.
Book Details: View detailed information about a book.
Add to Cart: Add books to the shopping cart.
Cart Management: View and remove books from the cart.
Checkout: Complete the purchase by submitting a form with user information.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, React Router, Axios
Backend: Flask, Flask-RESTful, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, Flask-CORS
Database: SQLite (Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM)
Authentication: (Add if applicable, such as JWT tokens for authentication)

Setup Instructions
1. Install Backend Dependencies
To set up the backend, navigate to the server/ directory and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd server
pipenv install
pipenv shell
Then, run the Flask API:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Your Flask backend should now be running at http://localhost:5555.

2. Install Frontend Dependencies
To set up the frontend, navigate to the client/ directory and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd client
npm install
Then, start the React application:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Your React app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

3. Generate Database
To generate your database, you need to initialize the database and run the migrations:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd server
flask db init
flask db upgrade
